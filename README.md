## What is Graph in Data Structure and Algorithms?

  
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(E, V).


## Graphs properties:-

### **Distance between two Vertices:**

It is basically the number of edges that are available in the shortest path between vertex A and vertex B.If there is more than one edge which is used to connect two vertices then we basically considered the shortest path as the distance between these two vertices.
```
Notation used :
d(A, B)
here function d is basically showing the distance between vertex A and vertex B.
```

### Diameter of A Connected Graph:

Unlike the radius of the connected graph here we basically used the maximum value of eccentricity from all vertices to determine the diameter of the graph.

```
Notation used:
d(G)
where G is the connected graph.
```
### Difference between Graph and Tree:
In the programming world, trees and graphs are important factors and depict nonlinear data. A tree is an exceptional case of a graph which does not loop whereas graphs can have loops. Both graph and tree share some common features but they do have some differences. Letâ€™s explore the differences between tree and graph.

## What is a Tree?

In the computer science world, a tree is renowned as a hierarchical and nonlinear data structure that directly stores data in a hierarchical manner.

## What is Graph?

In the computer science world, a graph is popular as a non-linear data structure that is generally used to depict the flow of computation. It is also connected by nodes and edges.
